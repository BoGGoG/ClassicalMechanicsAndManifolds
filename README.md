# Mathematical Notes on Riemannian Geometry, General Relativity and Lagrangian Mechanics


These are my notes for Riemannian Geometry, General Relativity and Lagrangian Mechanics.
The first part are basically notes from the [very good lectures] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G4SqIboeig&list=PLFeEvEPtX_0S6vxxiiNPrJbLu9aK1UVC_)
by Frederic Schuller.

One of my goals is to explain why in Lagrangian Mechanics $q$ and $\dot{q}$ are independent.

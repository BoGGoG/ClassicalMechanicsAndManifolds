# Mathematical Notes on Riemannian Geometry, General Relativity and Lagrangian Mechanics


These are my notes for Riemannian Geometry, General Relativity and Lagrangian Mechanics.
The first part are basically notes from the [very good lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G4SqIboeig&list=PLFeEvEPtX_0S6vxxiiNPrJbLu9aK1UVC_)
by Frederic Schuller.

The goals are:
- Give a precice introduction to Riemannian Geometry
- Use that knowledge to understand Lagrangian Mechanics
- Extend to General Relativity
